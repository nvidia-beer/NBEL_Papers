## Overview

This paper presents a low-power, adaptive control system for a wheelchair-mounted robotic arm. The controller uses a spiking neural network on Intel's Loihi chip to integrate proprioceptive velocity data (from an accelerometer) and guide the arm's movements, with online learning for adaptation to changes like lifting heavy objects.

### The Problem

- Existing assistive arms are rare due to cost and high power use.
- Adaptation is needed when external conditions change (for example, picking up a heavy object changes the arm's dynamics).
- Conventional controllers require manual retuning for each change.

### Key Math

#### Neuromorphic Sensor Integration

Integrating accelerometer data to get position using recurrent SNNs.

#### PES Learning for Adaptation

- Adaptive control using a spiking neural network implemented with the **[Neural Engineering Framework (NEF)](NEF.md)**.
- Uses the **[Prescribed Error Sensitivity (PES)](PES.md)** learning rule for online adaptation on the Loihi neuromorphic chip.

### What They Did

**Hardware:**
- Custom 6-DOF robotic arm with Dynamixel XM540 and XM430 actuators
- Wheelchair-mounted, plus a 3D-printed gripper
- Velocity readings from a ZED stereo camera's onboard accelerometer
- Controlled via Intel Kapoho Bay board with 2 Loihi chips

**Neural Network:**
- Tested with 100, 1,000, and 5,000 neurons per dimension
- Synaptic time constants: 0.01, 0.1, and 1 s (tested for integration)

### Experiments

**Adaptation:**
- Demonstrated robust adaptation to a 2 kg payload (real-time learning to compensate for added weight)
- Adaptation convergence is fast (approx. 150 ms to reach target after change)

### Results

- Accurate motion guidance for arm trajectories needed in activities of daily living (ADLs)
- Adaptive control achieves better accuracy when payload changes, compared to non-adaptive control
- Feedback from 10 care stakeholders (therapists, developers, etc.):
    - Positive impressions on appearance, safety, and usefulness
    - Key requirements: affordable price, speed limits, safety functions

### Why This Matters

- Neuromorphic controllers on Loihi enable fast, efficient adaptation in assistive robotics
- System uses affordable sensors and custom hardware, with strong user/clinician input
- Demonstrates feasibility for energy-efficient, robust, adaptive wheelchair-mounted robotics

### Connection to Other Work

Builds on the Neural Engineering Framework and demonstrates real-world application of neuromorphic control for assistive devices.
